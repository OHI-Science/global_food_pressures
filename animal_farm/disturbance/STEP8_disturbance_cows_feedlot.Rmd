## Setup
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(here)
library(countrycode)

source(here("_workflow/common.R"))
source(here("_workflow/common_spatial.R"))
source(here("_spatial/template_raster.R"))


```

We are going to use 215 sqft/head for space, and then multiply that by 2 to account for the extra area of the feedlot. This is ~ 20 m2

Read in the feedlot location file

```{r}
feedlots <- raster(file.path(prep, "animal_farm/farm/location_tifs/cows_feedlot_meat.tif"))

km2_head <- 20/1000000
extra_farm_area <- 2

feedlot_disturbance <- feedlots*km2_head*extra_farm_area

      names(feedlot_disturbance) <- "km2_eq"

     
writeRaster(feedlot_disturbance, file.path(paste0(layers, "land_cows_feedlot_meat_disturbance.tif", sep = "")), format = "GTiff", overwrite = TRUE ) 

plot(feedlot_disturbance)

```
