Grab the HYDE data 
```{r}
graze <- raster(file.path(raw, "HYDE/baseline/2017AD_lu/grazing2017AD.asc"), crs = food_crs)
plot(graze)
```

We want to figure out the distribution of the proportion of cells grazed wise
```{r}

graze_prop <- graze/area(graze)

# plot histogram
hist(graze_prop,
     main = "Distribution of proportion of grazed in each cell (with 0)",
     xlab = "Proportion", ylab = "Frequency",
     col = "hotpink4")

graze_prop[graze_prop == 0] <- NA
hist(graze_prop,
     main = "Distribution of proportion of grazed in each cell (remove 0)",
     xlab = "Proportion", ylab = "Frequency",
     col = "darkseagreen")


```
