This series of scripts determines which catch is forage fish used in feed
based on a list of feed fish species from Froehlich et al. and fishery records from Watson:
STEP1_forage_fish_ID.Rmd


The total pressure of global feed fish fisheries are then determined:

STEP4_feedfish_disturbance.Rmd
To calculate feedfish disturbance, we needed the following:
A total accounting of all fisheries disturbance: STEP3_marinefisheries_disturbance.Rmd and STEP2_NPP_prep.Rmd to control for differences in productivity.

STEP5_feedfish_ghg.Rmd
STEP6_feedfish_nutrients.Rmd
STEP7_feedfish_water.Rmd
