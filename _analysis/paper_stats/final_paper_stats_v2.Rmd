## Check the origin of cumulative pressures

**Aquatic systems produce only 1.1% of food but 9.9% of global footprint.**

**Contributions from land (89.9% of global cumulative pressure) vastly outweigh those from oceans (9.9%) or freshwater ecosystems (0.2%), yet these ocean pressures are substantial given that relatively little (1.1%, by tonnes) food and feed for fed animals comes from the sea.**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rescale <- read_csv("../rescale_values.csv")

### do overall, including feed and fodder

  left_join(rescale, by = "pressure") %>%

## Check the top 1% of pixels for cumulative pressures

**The top 1% of pixels with respect to cumulative pressures (5,114,880km2 total) fall nearly entirely on land (only 94,608km2, or 1.8% of this top 1%, fall in the ocean, and none in the high seas) and produce 39.4% of foodâ€™s global cumulative pressure and 30.9% of assessed tonnage of food. They occur primarily in India, China, the U.S., Brazil, and Indonesia (Fig. 2a). Nearly all pressures (92.5%) are exerted in just 10% of pixels.**

## Check the proportion of cumulative pressures by country

**The cumulative pressure imposed by food production is greatest in India, China, Brazil, the U.S., and Pakistan (Fig. 4). These 5 countries alone contribute nearly half (43.8%) of global cumulative pressure.**


**Fig. 4. Proportional contribution to the cumulative food footprint in the highest ranking countries and the high seas for A) each pressure summed across all food types, or B) each food type summed across four pressure classes. These areas have the highest proportion of cumulative environmental pressure, and collectively account for 70.9% of the global footprint of food production.**

## Check statistics that correspond to figure 5 (the barchart)

**For example, the ruminant digestive system of cows makes their GHG emissions noteworthy (53% of their cumulative pressures), along with nutrient emissions from their wastes and feed production (31%). The footprint of rice, and wheat crops more strongly reflects water use and disturbed land area (Fig. 5). Assessing the cumulative pressures of different foods by country also reveals that crop production, consumed by both people and livestock, dominates overall pressure in nearly all countries, but there are some exceptions such as Brazil, which has relatively high cumulative pressures from meat production (Fig. 4b). **

 - code from fig 4
 

OLD: 

**Importantly, food types often rank differently in their global cumulative pressure compared to ratings derived from per-unit assessments of individual classes of pressure. For example, we find that the cumulative footprint of catching demersal fishes is 2x that of raising sheep for meat, which is counter to common generalisations.**
 

new: 
**In this figure, pigs have a total cumulative pressure of ~0.15X (i.e. 15% of the total pressure of all foods globally), while rice is ~9%. The reason pigs are higher is because its pressure from excess nutrients encompasses so much of the total pressure of all foods globally (9.4% of the total pressure of all foods globally, versus 1.2%). Rice has higher GHG emissions (3.1% for rice, 1.7% for pigs) and water use (2.8% for water, 1.9% for pigs). Disturbance is about the same (1.5% for rice, 1.7% for pigs). These kinds of comparisons are a key reason we did our study and are only possible with our approach, i.e. this is the first time such comparisons have been possible.**

## compare origin of pressure by organisms

 - compare magnitudes of pigs/chickens cumulative pressures on land to that of mariculture species 
    - pigs ocean cumulative pressure is similar to that of crustaceans, salmon, and marine fish general in ocean 
    - chickens ocean cumulative pressure is similar to that of tuna in water.
    

"The cumulative pressure for fed animals spreads far beyond the farm where they are raised. For example, because marine forage fish comprise an average of ~0.15% of chicken and ~0.02% of pig feed, these livestock have similar cumulative ocean footprints to that of some mariculture species (Fig. 5). Feed for mariculture species increasingly includes crops, and all fed species have >98% of their footprint on land (Data S4)."

## Check the displacement of cumulative pressure that happens due to crop exports 

**More broadly, use of feed for livestock displaces on average X% of a countryâ€™s cumulative footprint to other countries (range: X-X%; Suppl. Table XX).**


```{r}
ex_im_stress <- read_csv(here("_analysis/export_import_stressors/data/cumulative_stress_imports_exports.csv"))

# ds indicates "domestic supply"

# To get the actual percent of a countryâ€™s displacement of their cumulative pressure, you need to multiply prop_exported x prop_ds_produced

# To get just the exported of the crops actually produced in the country, you need to multiply it by the proportion of domestic supply that is produced (prop_ds_produced)

ex_im_crops <- ex_im_stress %>%
  mutate(prop_exportc = prop_exported*prop_ds_produced)

mean(ex_im_stress$prop_exported, na.rm = TRUE) # 0.1511889

mean(ex_im_crops$prop_exportc, na.rm = TRUE) # 0.1165849

# so this means that on average 12% of a country's cumulative pressure is exported 

# range
range(ex_im_crops$prop_exportc, na.rm = TRUE) # 0.0000000 0.6478093

# 0% - 65%
```

 

## compare demersal and sheep production

**In some cases these differences are driven by the scale of production, for example demersal fishing is 4x greater production than sheep, so even though per-unit sheep are less efficient, demersal fishing exerts overall more cumulative pressure.**

all_prod <- read_csv("output/all_production.csv")

**We excluded wild-harvest and mariculture of seaweed and freshwater aquaculture because no comprehensive data exist for farm locations; however, the vast majority of freshwater aquaculture occurs in Asia (77.6% of global production in tonnes, with China producing 59.8%), and so inclusion of these data would primarily increase pressures in Asia.**
