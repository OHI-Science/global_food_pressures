Outline of datasets in this folder (some of which could potentially be used as supplementary tables)

"all_production.csv" 
 - This is a dataset which consists of the production (in tonnes) per country per food group. 
 
 "summary_cum_pressures_rescaled_categories.csv" 
  - Cumulative pressures per country and food group. 
 
 "country_land_ocean_food_dominations.csv"
  -  Domination thresholds (>50%, >80%), per country area (ocean or land), and food group. I.e. "Cow production for meat and milk is the single most influential sector, dominating (>50%) cumulative pressure across 40% of terrestrial pixels (of which 7.1% globally is from Russia"
  
 "percent_cum_pressure_country_origin_fw.csv"
  - Per country percents of rescaled cumulative pressures, per origin (freshwater, land, marine). 
 
 "percent_cum_pressure_country_origin.csv"
   - Per country percents of rescaled cumulative pressures, per origin (land (land + freshwater), marine). 
 
 "pressure_per_tonne_ranges.csv"
  - Efficiency ranges per food group, split by max, 90th quantile, median, 10th quantile, and min. 
 
 "land_ocean_food_dominations_prop.csv"
 - Per area (ocean, land), per food group, proportion dominated (50% or 80% thresholds)
 
 "percent_cum_pressure_organism.csv"
  - Per food group percent of cumulative global pressures. 
 
 "land_ocean_pressure_dominations_props.csv"
  - Per area (ocean, land), per pressure, proportion dominated (i,e, figure 2b, 2c bar charts). 
 
 "percent_cum_pressure_origin.csv"
  - Per area (ocean, land, freshwater, percent of cumulative pressure.
