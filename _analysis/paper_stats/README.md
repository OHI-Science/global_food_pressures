Outline of scripts in this folder

**final_paper_stats_v2.Rmd** 
 - This script contains data prep for results that are found in the main paper. There are a lot of excerpts from the paper, with the dataprep to get those values following.
 
 **total_production_stats.Rmd**
  - Similarly, this contains data prep for results found in the main paper. I split this into another script because the total production data prep is pretty lengthy and cluttered. 
  
**production_accounted_for.Rmd** 
 - This script contains information used to make Table S3 in the SI methods. 
 
**efficiency_stats**
 - This script contains information used to find the statistics for the main manuscript in the efficiency (or costs) section.
