Data on poultry-meat production reported by national statistical offices could be expressed in terms of either live weight, eviscerated weight, ready-to-cook weight or dressed weight. Data for countries reporting in other than ready-to-cook weight have been converted into the ready-to-cook equivalent. Ready-to-cook excludes: Blood, feathers, viscera, feet, head (may include or exclude: heart, liver, gizzard, neck).
