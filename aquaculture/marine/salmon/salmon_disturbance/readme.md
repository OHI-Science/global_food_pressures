# Salmon Aquaculture Disturbance

_Folder description_

This folder contains markdowns for calculations of the number of live stock at salmon farms, the total area production needs, and the final disturbance layer.

## Primary script: STEP2_occupancy_distribution.Rmd
This markdown uses the conversion factor calculated in STEP1_salmon_tonnes_to_livestock_conversion.Rmd to convert production data into spatially explicit number of live stock in the water. The proportion of each cell that is impacted is calculated and a final disturbance layer is created.
