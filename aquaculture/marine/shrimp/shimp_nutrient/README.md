# shrimp_nutrient

We used *Aquaculture Production is a Large, Spatially Concentrated Source of Nutrients in Chinese Freshwater and Coastal Seas* (2020 Wang et al) Table 1 data to extract nutrient pollution values (N and P) associated with live weight of shrimp from shrimp farming (for this we just used the crustaceans value, as no other data was available).
