# Script Description

This markdown calculates the GHG emissions from general finfish aquaculture. 

# Data information
We used [Seafood Carbon Emissions Tool data](http://seafoodco2.dal.ca/) to extract ghg emissions associated with carcass weight of finfish from finfish farming.

One factor that we added was aquatic N<sub>2</sub>O emissions as discussed in [Hu *et al*., 2012](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es300110x) and [MacLoid *et al*., 2019](http://www.fao.org/3/ca7130en/ca7130en.pdf).


# Methods 
 - Take midpoint of ghg low and ghg high from [seafood carbon emissions tool data](http://seafoodco2.dal.ca/) for all finfish species
 - Multiply by % energy (to cut out the feed emissions)
 - Add the N20 value from the MacLeod paper to the emissions intensity estimate we got for finfish
 - Multiply emissions intensity estimate by tonnes of production in each cell

## Filter for the appropriate species... also filter for "Marine net pen" and "Cages".. since we don't want any inland aquaculture
finfish_emissions_spp <- farmed_emissions %>%
  dplyr::filter(common_name %in% c("Almaco jack", "Barramundi", "California yellowtail", "Cobia", "European bass", "Gilt-head seabream", "Japanese amberjack", "Turbot")) %>%
  dplyr::filter(system %in% c("Marine net pen", "Cages"))

## after the filter we lost Turbot... there wasn't that much production anyways.

## This looks pretty good though... all of the ghg low and ghg high are generally between 2 and 4... with the exception of cobia. I feel comfortable just taking the midpoint. 


## multiply the ghg low and ghg high by the percent energy
## take the mean of new ghg low and high (the 25th and 75th quantiles)
finfish_emissions <- finfish_emissions_spp %>%
  dplyr::mutate(ghg_low_energy = ghg_low*(percent_energy/100),
                ghg_high_energy = ghg_high*(percent_energy/100)) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(ghg_kgCO2_kg_fish_mean = mean(c(ghg_low_energy, ghg_high_energy))) 

ghg_kgCO2_kg_fish <- mean(finfish_emissions$ghg_kgCO2_kg_fish_mean)

ghg_energy_kgCO2_kg_fish <- ghg_kgCO2_kg_fish # 0.381375 kg CO2eq/ kg fish (live/carcass weight, ratioed)

# Adding Aquatic N2O
# From MacLeod et al. 
# "The amount of N2O per species-group was determined by multiplying the
# production by the N2O emission factor per kg of production (Hu et al., 2012), i.e.
# 1.69 gN2O-N per kg of production, or 0.791 kgCO2e/kgLW production. This equates
# to a conversion rate of N to N2O-N of 1.8 percent, which is higher that the 0.71
# percent used in Henriksson et al. (2014a). "

# 0.791 kgCO2e/kgLW production 
ghg_total_kgCO2_kg_fish <- 0.791 + ghg_energy_kgCO2_kg_fish ## 1.172375

## convert to kgco2/tfish
GHG_kgCO2e_tfish <- ghg_total_kgCO2_kg_fish/0.001

## convert to MTco2e/tfish
GHG_MTCO2e_tfish <- GHG_kgCO2e_tfish/1000

finfish_ghg <- finfish_production %>%
  dplyr::mutate(finfish_ghg_tonnes = GHG_MTCO2e_tfish*tonnes_production) %>%
  dplyr::select(x,y, finfish_ghg_tonnes)

sum(finfish_ghg$finfish_ghg_tonnes) # 4583113

write.csv(finfish_ghg, file.path(prep_finfish, "marine_fish_general_ghg.csv"))

## Now multiply this by our production raster
finfish_production_raster <- rasterFromXYZ(finfish_production)
plot(log(finfish_production_raster + 1))
cellStats(finfish_production_raster, "sum") # 3901214

ghg_em <- finfish_production_raster*GHG_MTCO2e_tfish
plot(log(ghg_em + 1))
cellStats(ghg_em, "sum") # 4583113

# it worked

## Transform CRS to be appropriate
food_raster <- raster(nrows=2160, ncols=4320, xmn=-180, xmx=180, ymn=-90, ymx=90)

## Save the raster to datalayers folder
writeRaster(ghg_em_final, file.path(path_final, "marine_marine-fish-general_aquaculture_meat_ghg.tif"), overwrite = TRUE)

```


Datacheck: 

```{r}

## sum production
sum(finfish_production$tonnes_production) # 3901214

# now multiply that production by the ghg intensity calculated above: 
 
1.172375*3901214 #  4573686


## now check against the final ghg raster for bivalves 
mf_ghg <- raster(file.path(path_final, "marine_marine-fish-general_aquaculture_meat_ghg.tif"))
cellStats(mf_ghg, "sum") # 4573686 matches perfectly


## check our emissions against that of macleod et al... 

# they estimate ~2.5 million tonnes of production and ~2199000 tonnes of ghg emissions for 2013. Their emissions intensity appears to be a little less than 1 kgco2/LW for on farm energy and N20, which is the only ones we include. Our EI is ~1.17, so we may be over estimating a bit compared to macleod et al, but I don't believe it is egregious.
