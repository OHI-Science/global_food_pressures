This series of folders/scripts preps the aquaculture layers. 

To start, you should complete "STEP1_species_groups" first. These scripts prep the FAO data and summarise it per country and species group. 

After that, the order of the folders do not matter. 

I completed the species folders in the following order: 

 - salmon
   - salmon_ghg
   - salmon_disturbance
   - salmon_nutrient
   - salmon_water
 - shrimp 
   - shrimp_ghg
   - shrimp_disturbance
   - shrimp_nutrient
   - shrimp_water
 - bivalve
   - bivalve_ghg
   - bivalve_disturbance
   - bivalve_nutrient
   - bivalve_water
 - marine_fish_general
   - finfish_ghg
   - finfish_disturbance
   - finfish_nutrient
   - finfish_water
 - tuna
   - tuna_ghg
   - tuna_disturbance
   - tuna_nutrient
   - tuna_water
 - crustaceans
   - crustacean_ghg
   - crustacean_disturbance
   - crustacean_nutrient
   - crustacean_water
   
   
Root directory: 
 - production_rasters_extract.Rmd; extracts production from rasters to avoid reporting mismatches when calculating efficiency. 
 
 The farm location and production data used in these scripts are taken from the [mariculture mapping project](https://github.com/OHI-Science/aquaculture_mapping/tree/main/marine) led by Gage Clawson. [Mapping the Spatial Distribution of Global Mariculute Production](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738066); Clawson et al. 2022
 
Good luck!
